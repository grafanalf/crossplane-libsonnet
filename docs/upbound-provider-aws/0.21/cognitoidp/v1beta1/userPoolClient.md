## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of UserPoolClient

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts

```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified.

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

"Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation.

More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

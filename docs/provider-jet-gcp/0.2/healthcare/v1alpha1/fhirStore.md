## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of FHIRStore

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)
```

"Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only."

### fn metadata.withDeletionTimestamp

```ts
withDeletionTimestamp(deletionTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withFinalizers

```ts
withFinalizers(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn metadata.withFinalizersMixin

```ts
withFinalizersMixin(finalizers)
```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.

### fn metadata.withGenerateName

```ts
withGenerateName(generateName)
```

"GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.\n\nIf this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header).\n\nApplied only if Name is not specified. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#idempotency"

### fn metadata.withManagedFields

```ts
withManagedFields(managedFields)
```

"ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like \"ci-cd\". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object."

### fn metadata.withManagedFieldsMixin

```ts
withManagedFieldsMixin(managedFields)
```

"ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path like \"ci-cd\". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow used when modifying the object."

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withName

### fn metadata.withNamespace

```ts
withNamespace(namespace)
```

"Namespace defines the space within which each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the \"default\" namespace, but \"default\" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.\n\nMust be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces"

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferences

```ts
withOwnerReferences(ownerReferences)
```

"List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller."

### fn metadata.withOwnerReferencesMixin

```ts
withOwnerReferencesMixin(ownerReferences)
```

"List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing controller."

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withResourceVersion

```ts
withResourceVersion(resourceVersion)
```

"An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.\n\nPopulated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency"

### fn metadata.withSelfLink

withSelfLink(selfLink)
```

"SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.\n\nDEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release."

### fn metadata.withUid

```ts
withUid(uid)
```

"UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.\n\nPopulated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids"

## obj spec

"FHIRStoreSpec defines the desired state of FHIRStore"

### fn spec.withDeletionPolicy

```ts
withDeletionPolicy(deletionPolicy)
```

"DeletionPolicy specifies what will happen to the underlying external when this managed resource is deleted - either \"Delete\" or \"Orphan\" the external resource."

## obj spec.forProvider



### fn spec.forProvider.withDataset

```ts
withDataset(dataset)
```

"Identifies the dataset addressed by this request. Must be in the format 'projects/{project}/locations/{location}/datasets/{dataset}'"

### fn spec.forProvider.withDisableReferentialIntegrity

```ts
withDisableReferentialIntegrity(disableReferentialIntegrity)
```

"Whether to disable referential integrity in this FHIR store. This field is immutable after FHIR store creation. The default value is false, meaning that the API will enforce referential integrity and fail the requests that will result in inconsistent state in the FHIR store. When this field is set to true, the API will skip referential integrity check. Consequently, operations that rely on references, such as Patient.get$everything, will not return all the results if broken references exist. \n ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **"

### fn spec.forProvider.withDisableResourceVersioning

```ts
withDisableResourceVersioning(disableResourceVersioning)
```

"Whether to disable resource versioning for this FHIR store. This field can not be changed after the creation of FHIR store. If set to false, which is the default behavior, all write operations will cause historical versions to be recorded automatically. The historical versions can be fetched through the history APIs, but cannot be updated. If set to true, no historical versions will be kept. The server will send back errors for attempts to read the historical versions. \n ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) **"

### fn spec.forProvider.withEnableHistoryImport

```ts
withEnableHistoryImport(enableHistoryImport)
```

"Whether to allow the bulk import API to accept history bundles and directly insert historical resource versions into the FHIR store. Importing resource histories creates resource interactions that appear to have occurred in the past, which clients may not want to allow. If set to false, history bundles within an import will fail with an error. \n ** Changing this property may recreate the FHIR store (removing all data) ** \n ** This property can be changed manually in the Google Cloud Healthcare admin console without recreating the FHIR store **"

### fn spec.forProvider.withEnableUpdateCreate

```ts
withEnableUpdateCreate(enableUpdateCreate)
```

"Whether this FHIR store has the updateCreate capability. This determines if the client can use an Update operation to create a new resource with a client-specified ID. If false, all IDs are server-assigned through the Create operation and attempts to Update a non-existent resource will return errors. Please treat the audit logs with appropriate levels of care if client-specified resource IDs contain sensitive data such as patient identifiers, those IDs will be part of the FHIR resource path recorded in Cloud audit logs and Cloud Pub/Sub notifications."

### fn spec.forProvider.withLabels

```ts
withLabels(labels)
```

"User-supplied key-value pairs used to organize FHIR stores. \n Label keys must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}][\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-]{0,62} \n Label values are optional, must be between 1 and 63 characters long, have a UTF-8 encoding of maximum 128 bytes, and must conform to the following PCRE regular expression: [\\p{Ll}\\p{Lo}\\p{N}_-]{0,63} \n No more than 64 labels can be associated with a given store. \n An object containing a list of \"key\": value pairs.

```ts
withStreamConfigs(streamConfigs)
```

"A list of streaming configs that configure the destinations of streaming export for every resource mutation in this FHIR store. Each store is allowed to have up to 10 streaming configs. After a new config is added, the next resource mutation is streamed to the new location in addition to the existing ones. When a location is removed from the list, the server stops streaming to that location. Before adding a new config, you must add the required bigquery.dataEditor role to your project's Cloud Healthcare Service Agent service account. Some lag (typically on the order of dozens of seconds) is expected before the results show up in the streaming destination."

### fn spec.forProvider.withStreamConfigsMixin

```ts

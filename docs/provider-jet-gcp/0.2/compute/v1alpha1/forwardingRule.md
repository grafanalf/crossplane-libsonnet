## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

new returns an instance of ForwardingRule

## obj metadata

"ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects users must create."

### fn metadata.withAnnotations

```ts
withAnnotations(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

### fn metadata.withAnnotationsMixin

```ts
withAnnotationsMixin(annotations)
```

"Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations"

**Note:** This function appends passed data to existing values

### fn metadata.withClusterName

```ts
withClusterName(clusterName)
```

"The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources with same name and namespace in different clusters. This field is not set anywhere right now and apiserver is going to ignore it if set in create or update request."

### fn metadata.withCreationTimestamp

```ts
withCreationTimestamp(creationTimestamp)
```

"Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers."

### fn metadata.withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds

```ts
withDeletionGracePeriodSeconds(deletionGracePeriodSeconds)

```

"Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list."

### fn spec.forProvider.withNetwork

```ts
withNetwork(network)
```

"This field is not used for external load balancing. For `INTERNAL` and `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` load balancing, this field identifies the network that the load balanced IP should belong to for this Forwarding Rule. If this field is not specified, the default network will be used."

### fn spec.forProvider.withNetworkTier

### fn spec.forProvider.withPortRange

```ts
withPortRange(portRange)
```

"When the load balancing scheme is `EXTERNAL`, `INTERNAL_SELF_MANAGED` and `INTERNAL_MANAGED`, you can specify a `port_range`. Use with a forwarding rule that points to a target proxy or a target pool. Do not use with a forwarding rule that points to a backend service. This field is used along with the `target` field for TargetHttpProxy, TargetHttpsProxy, TargetSslProxy, TargetTcpProxy, TargetVpnGateway, TargetPool, TargetInstance. Applicable only when `IPProtocol` is `TCP`, `UDP`, or `SCTP`, only packets addressed to ports in the specified range will be forwarded to `target`. Forwarding rules with the same `[IPAddress, IPProtocol]` pair must have disjoint port ranges. Some types of forwarding target have constraints on the acceptable ports: \n *   TargetHttpProxy: 80, 8080 *   TargetHttpsProxy: 443 *   TargetTcpProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222 *   TargetSslProxy: 25, 43, 110, 143, 195, 443, 465, 587, 700, 993, 995, 1688, 1883, 5222 *   TargetVpnGateway: 500, 4500 \n @pattern: d+(?:-d+)?"

### fn spec.forProvider.withPorts

```ts
withPorts(ports)
```

"This field is used along with the `backend_service` field for internal load balancing. When the load balancing scheme is `INTERNAL`, a list of ports can be configured, for example, ['80'], ['8000','9000']. Only packets addressed to these ports are forwarded to the backends configured with the forwarding rule. If the forwarding rule's loadBalancingScheme is INTERNAL, you can specify ports in one of the following ways: * A list of up to five ports, which can be non-contiguous * Keyword `ALL`, which causes the forwarding rule to forward traffic on any port of the forwarding rule's protocol. @pattern: d+(?:-d+)?
